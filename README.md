# haustlegur
small farming game
to be expanded

## running
open it in godot and export it or use the html5 export in your favorite web server

## gameplay
arrow keys for movement

x to dig farmland

z to plant a carrot in farmland

c to dig up the carrot

n to spawn a butterfly

you can probably use a controller for at least movement but i wouldnt recommend it cause i never tested it
